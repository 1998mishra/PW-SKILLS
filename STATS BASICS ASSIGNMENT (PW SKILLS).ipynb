    "# Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "# A random variable is a numerical value associated with the outcomes of a random experiment. It assigns a number to each possible outcome of a random event. There are two main types of random variables: discrete and continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Discrete Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "# A discrete random variable takes on a countable number of distinct values. These variables are typically associated with outcomes that are the result of a counting process (like the number of heads in coin tosses or the number of customers arriving at a store).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can take only specific, distinct values (often integers).\n",
    "# The probability of each outcome is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# The number of students in a class (1, 2, 3, …).\n",
    "# The number of goals scored in a soccer match (0, 1, 2, …).\n",
    "                                              \n",
    "# Probability Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For discrete random variables, we use a probability mass function (PMF) to describe the probability of each possible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: The probability of getting heads in 3 coin tosses could be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# P(X = 0) = 0.125, P(X = 1) = 0.375, P(X = 2) = 0.375, P(X = 3) = 0.125\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "# A continuous random variable can take any value within a given range, often as the result of a measurement process (like height, weight, or time). These variables are uncountable because they can take an infinite number of possible values within a continuous range.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can take any value within a continuous range.\n",
    "# Probabilities are associated with intervals rather than specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The height of people (e.g., 170.25 cm, 170.26 cm, etc.).\n",
    "# The time it takes to finish a race (e.g., 12.53 seconds, 12.54 seconds, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For continuous random variables, we use a probability density function (PDF). The probability of the variable taking any specific value is zero, so we calculate the probability over intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: The probability that a person's height is between 160 cm and 170 cm.\n",
